# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

  Your answer: A hash in Ruby is a collection of unique keys and their values. Hashes are important because they help us organize data. I see hashes as being similar to arrays. 

  Researched answer: Hashes in Ruby hold unique key:value pairs. They help us organize AND create data. They are similar to arrays except that instead of their values being referenced by their index, they are referenced by their unique keys. 



2. What is a gem?

  Your answer: A gem is a collection of libraries that store Ruby data and can be reused by developers in their projects. I believe they are open source and can be accessed by anyone online. An example of a gem is Rails, which is a fullstack framework for web applications that I am currently exploring. 

  Researched answer: Ruby gems are open source libraries that contain Ruby code and are packaged with extra data. They allow programmers to use the code within the gem in their own program, without explicitly inserting that code. They are easy to install and can be done through a few commands on our local. 



3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer: Ruby on Rails is a fullstack framework for web applications that provides a pre-built structure for web app development. I am currently learning more about this program and its functionality but so far I have nothing but good things to say. I like its user-friendliness and the fact that I can use it to build a web application in such a short amount of time. 

  Researched answer: Ruby on Rails is an open-source web application development framework written in Ruby language that helps developers make web development fast and simple. It is a popular framework that is primarily used when working with business logic. It uses the popular MVC pattern, which stands for:
  The Model: which holds the data structure of the application. (back-end)
  The View: represents the visual part of the web app as web page templates. (front-end)
  The Controller: connects the data to the View and contains the business logic of the application. (back-end)

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: A relational database is a type of database that stores data that is related to one another. It structures data in an organized manner that make it easy for any data to be called upon by calling on its unique key. And yes, there are other types of databases such as object-oriented databases, though I have heard that relational databases are more commonly used due to their clean structure. 

  Researched answer: A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Data is stored in columns and rows that hold unique keys and attributes of the data, making it easy to call upon any specific data by naming its unique key. In this type of database, all the data is related to one another in some way. 



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Primary keys are used in relational databases to help neatly structure and organize data. As I mentioned above, relational databases structure data in tables, where every row of a table has a primary key named "id". They are important because they allow for specific data to be called upon by its primary key or id name. 

  Researched answer: Relational Databases store data in tables. These tables have rows of data, which represent an instance of a class. One very important attribute of every row in every table in a Rails application is the primary key, or ID. Primary keys are guaranteed to be unique, and are how we identify individual rows. They play an important role in relational databases because they ensure that the data is accurate and accessible. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: REST(which stands for REpresentational State Transfer) provides a consistent pattern to use in structuring routes. Following RESTful patterns makes it easier for developers to create and maintain routes and easier for users to understand what's happening as they use a web application.
A RESTful route is a route that provides mapping from HTTP verbs (get, post, put, delete, patch) to controller CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete). Instead of relying solely on the URL to indicate what site to visit, a RESTful route depends on the HTTP verb and the URL.

2. JSON: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data that is "self-describing" and easy to understand. It is plain text written in Javascript object notation that is used to send data between computers. 

3. ERB: ERB stands for Embedded Ruby. When you define any file as ".html.erb" that means it's an HTML file with ruby code embedded in it. It is the primary template system for including dynamic content in web pages.

4. Params: In Rails, params refers to the parameters being passed to the controller via a GET or POST request. I found other information on this topic, however, it was a bit confusing because some of the links I visited provided contradicting information on how params function in Rails. 

5. API: An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of code that governs the way software interacts with other software â€” it is the communication between the software that facilitates interaction.
